#hello_world_project

#Due to syntax differences in python 2 and 3 as a result of the
#'raw_input' command simply becoming 'input' in python 3, I decided to make two
#versions of the project.

#helloworld_py2.py is for python 2, and helloworld_py3.py is for python 3.

#The scripts simply ask for your name, ask you to give your computer a name, and 
#then changes the color of your command line to your favorite color.
